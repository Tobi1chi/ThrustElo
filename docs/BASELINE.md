# ThrustElo Baseline Checklist

This checklist captures parity targets from the desktop app before web rollout.

- Rank page renders table with sorting, search, and favorites.
- History page displays selected pilot graph with zoom and annotations.
- Info page displays pilot summary, achievements, weapons, and timeline.
- Duel page displays enemy table and duel graph.
- Favorites are persisted across app refresh.
- Last update timestamp is shown in UTC.

Recommended evidence capture:

- Desktop screenshots for Rank/History/Info/Duel/Home.
- Web screenshots for the same views after migration.
- A short note for any intentional behavior differences.
